There are different ways for a automatic recognition of musical note, one of them is through fundamental frequency ($f_0$). Many solutions and methods of automatic detection of $f_0$ already developed and presented, getting positive results. However, it's hard that one only solution has been effective in environments much different from these that it was proposed. Therefore, the present project approaches the development of a $f_0$ detector system for monophonic musical audios through digital signal processing, with the intention of mapping it, recording the fundamental frequencies sounded at every instant time. This work also evaluated the system developed, through experiments using a database built for it. It was perceived that the proposed system presents good answers, being necessary improvements in the treatment of the resonance effect.
